# Sons of Ordson

Sons of Ordson is a text based sandbox/adventure game created with Twine and Sugarcube 2. It uses the Twee3 and Tweego to combine .twee, .js, and .css files into a single page application. The game can be played at danielbarnes175.github.io/sonsofordson/

## Current Roadmap

If you're interested in seeing what features are planned, please see the [roadmap](https://github.com/danielbarnes175/SonsOfOrdson/issues/2).

## Contributing

If you're interested in creating a quest, you can either directly pull down the code and make a twee file in `src/story/quests`, and then submit a pull request. Or, you can submit the script for the quest (along with any relevant mechanics) as an issue on GitHub.

If you'd like to contribute in other ways, feel free to create an issue explaining what you want to contribute, or reach out to me directly. Art, writing, and even feature requests are all appreciated.
