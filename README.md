## Contributing

If you're interested in creating a quest, you can either directly pull down the code and make a twee file in `src/story/quests`, and then submit a pull request. Or, you can submit the script for the quest (along with any relevant mechanics) as an issue on GitHub.

If you'd like to contribute in other ways, feel free to create an issue explaining what you want to contribute, or reach out to me directly. Art, writing, and even feature requests are all appreciated.
