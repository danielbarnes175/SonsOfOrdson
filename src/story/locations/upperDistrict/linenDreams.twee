You push through the front doors leading into Linen Dreams. Inside the lobby are various important looking people of all races. Typically when notable people are travelling for business, they'll stay at Linen Dreams due to its incredible reputation, and proximity to the Salt Fort. Being so close to the Salt Fort, it can be kept secure by the royal guards for any patrons looking to rest their heads somewhere comfortable for the night.
