You make your way to the Port. There's boats all around. And water. And even a lighthouse in the distance! It's definitely a port.

:: Boat Charters
You walk over to the booth to charter a boat. Unfortunately, when you get there, you see a sign that says "Out Fishing". Maybe someone knows where the owner is at the tavern?
