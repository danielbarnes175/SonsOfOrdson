:: Green Raven
<<set $player.location="Green Raven">>\

As soon as you step into the Green Raven, you're greeted by Trina Ventiro, owner of Green Raven, the sleeziest bar in town, and also the village drunk.

"Welcome to the Green Raven, hun" she says, slurring her speech. "If you need anything, just sit at one of the tables, and I'll be right uh-with you."
