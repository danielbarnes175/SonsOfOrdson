:: General Metalworks
<<set $player.location="General Metalworks">>\
You push open the heavy metal door and step into the shop. The walls are lined with various weapons, and armors that would be useful for adventurers.

Deeper back, you're able to see part of the forge, but you know that it opens up into a much larger area that you cannot see. You're not shocked that it's a bit warmer in here than most other buildings in Ordson.
